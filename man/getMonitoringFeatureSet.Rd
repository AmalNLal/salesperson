\usage{
getMonitoringFeatureSet(times, incumbents, lower.bound = 0,
  include.costs = TRUE, raw.data = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{times}{[\code{numeric}]\cr
Times at which logging took place.}

\item{incumbents}{[\code{numeric}]\cr
Logged best value for each timing.}

\item{lower.bound}{[\code{numeric(1)}]\cr
Lower bound for the computation of the area under the curve.
Default is 0.}

\item{include.costs}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Should costs be included as an additional feature? Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{raw.data}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Set this to \code{TRUE} if you want the raw data computed on the
trajectory instead of the statistics.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
[\code{list}] Named list.
