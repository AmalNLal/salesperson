\title{Feature: fraction of points near bounding boxplot.}
\usage{
getBoundingBoxFeatureSet(x, distance_fraction = 0.1,
  include.costs = FALSE, normalize = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{[\code{Network}]\cr
Network.}

\item{distance_fraction}{[\code{numeric}]\cr
Fraction of distance between min and max coordinates of each dimension
which should points be allowed lie inbetween.}

\item{include.costs}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Should costs be included as an additional feature? Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{normalize}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Additionally calculate the normalization for the features? The default is
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{[any]\cr
Not used.}
}
\value{
[\code{list}]
