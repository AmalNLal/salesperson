\title{Compute Custom Features 24 to 32}
\arguments{
\item{solver_path}{[\code{character}]\cr
Path to the solver executable.}

\item{instance_path}{[\code{character}]\cr
Path to the instance file.}
}
\value{
A vector containing the computed features.
}
\description{
This function computes a set of custom features (features 24 to 32) based on the solver's output.
It involves calling the solver with different parameters, collecting results, and calculating features.
The function iterates 20 times to gather statistics.
