\title{Feature: statistics of angles between nodes and their two nearest neighbors.}
\usage{
getAngleFeatureSet(x, feature.set = NULL, drop.duplicates = FALSE,
  include.costs = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{[\code{Network}]\cr
Network.}

\item{feature.set}{[\code{character}]\cr
Subset of angle feature sets that should be computed. Possible choices are
\code{"angle"} (statistics based on the angles between nodes and their two
nearest neighbors) and \code{"cos"} (statistics based on the cosine of the
aforementioned angles). Per default (\code{NULL}), both feature sets will
be computed.}

\item{drop.duplicates}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Should duplicated node coordinates be dropped?
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{include.costs}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Should costs be included as an additional feature?
Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
[\code{list}]
}
\description{
Feature: statistics of angles between nodes and their two nearest neighbors.
}
\details{
In case \code{include.costs = TRUE} the output will provide up to three
  separate cost values: one for the initialization phase, and one for each of the
  feature sets that were defined in \code{feature.set}. As the initialization
  phase is a mandatory prerequisite for computing either of the two feature sets,
  the user will manually have to add the costs of the initialization phase to the
  costs of the respective feature set(s).
