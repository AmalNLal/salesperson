#' @param get.distances [\code{logical(1)}]\cr
#'   Should distances be loaded?
#'   For really large instances the distance matrix may be very large.
#'   In certain situations it is thus desirable to load the instance without
#'   loading/generating the distance matrix itself.
#'   Default is \code{TRUE}.
