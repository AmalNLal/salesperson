#' @param keep.output.files [\code{logical(1)}]\cr
#'   Flag indicating whether output files shall be kept or deleted.
#'   Default is \code{FALSE}, i.e., output files are processed and
#'   output is loaded into R object. Afterwards the output files are
#'   deleted. This flag is particularly useful in large benchmark studies if
#'   \code{work.dir} and \code{output.files.prefix} is set.
